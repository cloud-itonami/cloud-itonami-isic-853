(ns highereds.store
  "SSoT for the ISIC-853 higher-education COORDINATION actor,
  behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the
  same seam every `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses.

  This actor coordinates the back-office operations of a higher-education
  institution (university, college): enrollment/advising appointment scheduling,
  facility/classroom booking coordination, consumable supply coordination
  (office/admin supplies), staff shift proposals, and safety-concern flagging
  (wellbeing incidents, mental-health risk signals). It never touches grading,
  academic assessment, curriculum selection, pedagogical decisions, admissions
  decisions, academic standing/probation/expulsion determinations, degree
  conferral, disciplinary action, or any safety-authority override -- see
  `highereds.governor`'s `scope-exclusion-violations`, a HARD, permanent,
  un-overridable block.

  `MemStore` -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for dev/tests/demo
  (no deps). A `students` directory keyed by `:student-id` STRING (never a
  keyword -- consistent keying from the start, avoiding the silent-miss
  bug that plagued an earlier shepherd attempt).

  A registered/verified student record must exist before ANY proposal
  for that student may ever commit or escalate -- `highereds.governor`'s
  `student-unverified-violations` re-derives this from the student's own
  `:registered?`/`:verified?` fields, never from proposal self-report,
  the SAME 'ground truth, not self-report' discipline every sibling
  actor's own governor uses.

  The ledger stays append-only: which student a proposal targeted, which
  operation, on what basis, committed/held/escalated and approved by
  whom is always a query over an immutable log.

  `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible EAV
  store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`, so it runs offline AND
  can be pointed at a real Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by
  swapping `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see `langchain.kotoba-db`) -- the
  same seam `cloud-itonami-isic-7810`'s `employmentops.store` and every
  other flagship-tier sibling actor's store uses. Both backends satisfy
  the SAME `Store` protocol and pass the same contract
  (`test/highereds/store_test.clj`), which is the whole point: the
  actor, `highereds.governor` and the audit ledger never know which
  SSoT they run on."
